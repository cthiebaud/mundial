**Renderers:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `wc2026_chain_parameterized.html` | Generic renderer — loads any chain via `?data=<file>` (default: `_main.json`) |
| `wc2026_chain_longest.html` | Snake renderer for the longest chain — loads any chain via `?data=<file>` (default: `_longest.json`) |
| `wc2026_chain_directed.html` | Directed-graph renderer — loads `_directed.json` |

**Data:**

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `wc2026_chain_main.json` | UK → France → … → Croatia (7 hops) |
| `wc2026_chain_longest.json` | Full longest chain (12 edges, 13 nodes) |
| `wc2026_chain_directed.json` | Directed graph of all chains |
| `wc2026_chain_italy.json` | Italy variant (Marcus Thuram first link) |
| `wc2026_chain_kaz.json` | Kazakhstan → … → Algeria (5 hops) |

## Running locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/
```

The map uses `fetch()` and requires an HTTP server — `file://` will not work.

## i18n

The UI language follows the browser locale. Supported: **French** (`fr`), **German** (`de`), **Italian** (`it`), English (fallback). Country names use the browser's `Intl.DisplayNames` API.

## Tooltip

Hovering a country shows a two-column tooltip when the country both has players born there playing for other nations AND is a qualified nation — the left column shows players born there playing elsewhere, the right column shows players born elsewhere playing for that nation. Collapses to one column when either side is empty. Player names in the dim-mode table link to their Wikipedia page in the UI language, with an `(en)` fallback.
