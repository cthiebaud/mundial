| `wc2026_chain_directed.html` | Directed-graph renderer — loads `_directed.json` |

**Data:**

| File | Content |

## Running locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/
```

The map uses `fetch()` and requires an HTTP server — `file://` will not work.

## Layout

The page has three fixed/sticky zones:

- **Fixed header** (`#page-header`, `z-index: 200`): contains the page quote, attribution, and legend bar. Sits at the very top.
- **Fixed map** (`#map-container`, `z-index: 100`): positioned immediately below the header via a CSS variable (`--page-header-h`). `body.paddingTop` is set by JS to the map container's measured bottom edge so content scrolls below it.
- **Scrollable bottom panel** (`#bottom-panel`): three Bootstrap tabs — **Elo ranking**, **Players** (dim-mode player table), **Longest path** (chain infographic).

**Portrait mobile only** (`max-width: 767.98px` + `orientation: portrait`):
- The tab bar is fixed at the bottom of the viewport above the browser chrome.
- `body { padding-bottom: 48px }` keeps the last line of tab content clear of the fixed tab bar.

Landscape mobile and desktop are unaffected by the portrait-only rules.

## Filter sidebar

A collapsible filter panel lives in the fixed header (right edge, CSS grid overlap). It controls which countries are shown in the Elo ranking list and which flags are visible on the map. The filter cube is `qualified × importer × exporter`:

| Category | Default |
|---|---|
| Qualified + importer + exporter | ✓ |
| Qualified + importer only | ✓ |
| Qualified + exporter only | ✓ |
| Qualified, neither | ✓ |
| Non-qualified + exporter | ✓ |
| Non-qualified, neither | unchecked |

Clicking any row/column header toggles all its checkboxes at once.

## Map special cases

**UK home nations**: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are treated as independent entities (synthetic IDs 8260–8263, flag codes `gb-eng` / `gb-sct` / `gb-wls` / `gb-nir`). The world atlas feature for "United Kingdom" (id=826) is skipped; `uk-nations.geojson` renders the four nations as separate choropleth polygons.

**Kosovo**: Not in the iso-3166-1 package's numeric table. Assigned id=383, alpha-2=`xk`. The world-atlas 110m topojson has a Kosovo geometry with no `id` field — patched at runtime before any topojson processing. Displayed in the Elo list with `rank: null`.

**Non-qualified countries**: All countries are clickable on the map and in the Elo list. For countries that don't activate dim mode, clicking pans and zooms the map to that country's centroid (`zoomToCentroid`, k=8). In the Elo list these appear as `elo-item--zoomable` pills (cursor:pointer, hover tint, colour stays `#bbb` to preserve the three-tier visual hierarchy).

## i18n

The UI language follows the browser locale. Supported: **French** (`fr`), **German** (`de`), **Italian** (`it`), **Spanish** (`es`), English (fallback). Country names use the browser's `Intl.DisplayNames` API. Wikipedia player links are available in all five languages; other locales fall back to the English Wikipedia URL.

## Tooltip

Hovering a country triggers one of several tooltip variants (desktop only — tooltips are disabled on mobile):

| Situation | Tooltip shown |
|---|---|
| Players born there, playing for another country (any country) | Export tooltip — single column; non-qualified countries show a *not qualified* badge |
| Qualified nation, no exports, but imported players | Import-only tooltip |
| Qualified nation with both exports and imports | Two-column tooltip: left = exports, right = imports |
| Qualified nation, no exports, no imports | Qualified tooltip with "no export / no import" message |

In dim mode (after clicking a country on the map or in the Elo list), hovering a destination flag shows that nation's incoming players from the selected source; hovering a birth-country flag shows its players selected by the dim'd nation. Clicking the active country again clears dim mode.

Player names in the dim-mode player table link to their Wikipedia page in the UI language, with an English fallback.
